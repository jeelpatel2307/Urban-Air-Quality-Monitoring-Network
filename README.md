# Urban Air Quality Monitoring Network

## Overview

This project simulates an Urban Air Quality Monitoring Network implemented in Java. The network collects air quality data from various locations within urban areas and provides insights into the overall air quality levels based on predefined thresholds.

## Features

- **Location-Based Monitoring:** Allows users to input a location for air quality monitoring.
- **Air Quality Data Retrieval:** Retrieves air quality data for the specified location from the monitoring network.
- **Air Quality Level Determination:** Determines the overall air quality level based on predefined thresholds for particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/urban-air-quality-monitoring-network.git>
    
    ```
    
2. **Compile and Run:**
    
    ```bash
    cd urban-air-quality-monitoring-network
    javac UrbanAirQualityMonitoringNetwork.java
    java UrbanAirQualityMonitoringNetwork
    
    ```
    
3. **Enter Location:**
    
    Enter the location for air quality monitoring when prompted.
    

## Usage

1. **Enter Location:**
    
    Input a location for air quality monitoring to retrieve air quality data and determine the overall air quality level.
    
2. **View Air Quality Level:**
    
    The system will display the overall air quality level for the specified location.
